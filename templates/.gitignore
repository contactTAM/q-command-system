# Q-Command System .gitignore Template
# Copy this file to your project's .gitignore (or merge with existing)

# Ignore .q-system session files (recommended)
# Keeps session files local, but tracks config and version
.q-system/transcripts/
.q-system/session-notes/
.q-system/checkpoints/
.q-system/prompts/
.q-system/memory/

# Keep these tracked:
# - .q-system/version (for upgrades)
# - .q-system/config.md (your preferences)
# - .q-system/README.md (folder documentation)
# - .q-system/docs/ (Q-System documentation)

# ---
# ALTERNATIVE: Ignore entire .q-system folder
# ---
# If you want to keep ALL session files local (not in git), use this instead:
# .q-system/
#
# This keeps git history clean but means session files only exist locally.
# Good for personal projects or when using external backup.

# ---
# ALTERNATIVE: Track everything
# ---
# If you want complete work history in git (for compliance, client work,
# or team transparency), don't add any .q-system entries to .gitignore.
