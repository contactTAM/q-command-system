# Q-Command System .gitignore Template
# Add these lines to your project's .gitignore

# Option 1: Ignore entire .q-system folder (recommended for most projects)
# Keeps session files local only
.q-system/

# Option 2: Track some .q-system content
# If you want to track configuration but not session files, use these instead:
# .q-system/transcripts/
# .q-system/session-notes/
# .q-system/checkpoints/
# .q-system/prompts/
# .q-system/memory/

# ---
# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# ---
#
# OPTION 1: Exclude .q-system from git (recommended)
#   - Keeps git history clean and lightweight
#   - Session files only on your local machine
#   - Good for personal projects or when using external backup
#   - Use: Add ".q-system/" to your .gitignore
#
# OPTION 2: Include in git (full audit trail)

#   - Team can review each other's sessions
#   - Good for client work, compliance, or team transparency
#   - Use: Don't add .q-system to .gitignore
#
# Choose based on your project needs.
# You can also configure this in .q-system/config.md
