# CONFIGURATION OPTION
# ---
#
# You have two choices for session files:
#
# OPTION 1: Exclude from git (current configuration)
#   - Keeps git history clean and lightweight
#   - Session files only on your local machine
#   - Good for personal projects or when using external backup
#   - To use: Keep this .gitignore as-is
#
# OPTION 2: Include in git (full audit trail)
#   - Complete work history in git
#   - Team can review each other's sessions
#   - Good for client work, compliance, or team transparency
#   - To use: Comment out or remove the ignore rules above
#
# Choose based on your project needs.
