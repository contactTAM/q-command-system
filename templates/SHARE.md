Hey [Name],

Found something you might like. It's called a "Q" — basically Claude Code set up to remember everything about your project across sessions.

The difference from regular Claude:
- It knows your project, your goals, your progress
- It picks up where you left off, even weeks later
- It has a methodology for getting from A to B

There's one for [DOMAIN] that might help with [USE_CASE].
